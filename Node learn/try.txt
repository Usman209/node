So you can't really hide it
http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/
So if you keep most of the logic up in the server it'd protect the code
And have the code on the Pi react to responses from the server
That's one way to keep things separate
And write code on the Pi that reacts to information from the server
It helps to think of the Pi as a web client

But it is generally open for tinkering
Sure but I wouldn't worry about that yet
Of course there are ways around it by making executables
Chances are you'll end up re-writing it in C after you prototype
If you mass produce it
Think of this as tinkering
First
Prototyping
You'll probably end up not worrying about proprietary code
In my experience
.........................
Yes you can
Again...my guess is you'll end up re-writing for production in C, but yes you could use py2exe or something like that
Similar stuff for Node
Not sure what you are building
Anyways yes to all your questions :wink:
